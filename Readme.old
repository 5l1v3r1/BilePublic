BiLE public release data
2004/10/26
-------------------------

For BiLE to work you'll need:
- httrack (just about any version would do)

CPAN modules:
- SOAP::Lite
- HTML::LinkExtor

And a valid Google API key (api.google.com).

Step zero - configure the constants listed in bile-public-ext.pl. These are:

my $GOOGLEPAGECOUNT=5; 
#How many seconds to wait for a page on Google

my $HTTRACKTIMEOUT=60; 
#How long to wait for the mirror of a site to complete

my $HTTRACKTEMPDIR="/tmp"; 
# Where to store temporary mirrors

my $HTTRACKCMD="/usr/bin/httrack";
# The location of the HTTtrack executable

my $GOOGLEKEY="<<INSERT YOUR GOOGLE API KEY HERE>>";
# Your Google API key

my $GOOGLE_WSDL="file:GoogleSearch.wsdl";
# Location of the Google WSDL file

Step one would be to run bile-public-ext.pl. It takes two arguments:
- argument one: the web site (e.g. www.abc.com)
- argument two: the output file (where the pairs will be written to)

Step two - use bile-public-weigh.pl to compute the weights:
- argument one: the web site 
- argument two: the input file containing the pairs (generated in step one)
- argument three: the output file - where the weights will be written


Good luck and enjoy.
